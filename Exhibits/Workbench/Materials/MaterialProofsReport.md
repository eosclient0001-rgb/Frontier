# Material Proofs Report — GREEN

Date: 2026-09-16 · Branch: `arena/01a0aa50-slate` · Gate: `bash Exhibits/Workbench/Materials/CheckMaterialsProof.sh`

The gate compiles the two dependency-free CPU proofs with the system compiler (no Vulkan, no submodules) and
runs them with a fixed splitmix64 seed, so every number below is **deterministic** — re-running the gate
reproduces this transcript bit-for-bit (full logs: `/tmp/MaterialsProof.coverage.log`,
`/tmp/MaterialsProof.furnace.log`).

**Score: 3,451 furnace checks + 110 coverage checks, 0 failures.**

---

## 1. Coverage proof — the plan §0 table as code (110/110)

Proves the CPU `MaterialIndex` (records, flags, fold/mix, channel×stage registry) matches the plan. Highlights:

- **Record mirror** — 58-float descriptor prefix memcpy-identical into the slab record; 16/16 texture
  slots + uvsets; thin-walled bit, rotation lane, reserved-lanes-zero; record is 304 B with pinned offsets.
- **Flags + complexity** — plain→Simple, coat→Single, transmission→Special, 2 slabs→Complex.
- **Retention (Sultan-42 §5)** — `Finalise` never mutates the descriptor (unread channels retained).
- **Flatten** — 3→1 folds two, top coat/rotation carried down, fractional mix at limit 2, Weight/Coverage ops.
- **Channel × stage registry** — 17 wired-or-partial, 3 acked gaps (verbatim):

## 2. Furnace proof — `MaterialEvaluation.slang` compiled 1:1 as C++ (3451/3451)

The shader under test is `#include`d as C++ through `SlangCpuShim.h`, so these numbers are the shipped
shading code, not a model of it. Tables are baked fresh each run (32×32, 1024 spp/cell).

### EON diffuse — furnace vs analytic, ceiling, multi-scatter floor

```
ok EON r=0 == Lambert at mu=0.05/0.30/0.60/1.00 (0.50000 ×4)
ok EON furnace r=0.5 mu=0.25 num=0.4888 ana=0.4902 | mu=0.60 num=0.4768 ana=0.4764 | mu=1.00 num=0.4670 ana=0.4670
ok EON furnace r=1.0 mu=0.25 num=0.4827 ana=0.4818 | mu=0.60 num=0.4563 ana=0.4564 | mu=1.00 num=0.4390 ana=0.4390
ok EON never exceeds rho (6/6) · ok EON MS floor (6/6)
```

### GGX + Kulla–Conty (white F0) — single-scatter vs table, compensated = 1

```
r=0.15: ss=0.9703/0.9992/0.9996 vs table, compensated E=1.0015/1.0010/1.0001
r=0.55: ss=0.8888/0.8209/0.8747 vs table, compensated E=0.9993/1.0000/1.0006
r=1.00: ss=0.7604/0.4500/0.3057 vs table, compensated E=0.9957/0.9925/0.9873
```

The Kulla–Conty compensation restores unity even at r=1.0 (worst 0.9873, within the ±0.02 furnace tolerance).

### Fuzz bound + coat stack — sheen albedo grid + stack ceiling

- 100/100 sheen albedos ≤ 1 over (a × μ) grid; worst R = 0.7307 (a=0.9, μ=0.02, grazing).
- `coat+fuzz+base stack albedo ≤ 1 (mu=0.3 E=0.5184, mu=0.8 E=0.4194)`.

### Reciprocity — Helmholtz, exact to float noise

```
ok EON reciprocal (worst 1.19e-07) · ok GGX single-scatter reciprocal (0.00e+00) · ok Kulla–Conty reciprocal (0.00e+00)
```

(Coat stack excluded by design — a tilted coat frame is not a reciprocal configuration.)

### Sampling consistency — E[f·cosθ/pdf] reproduces the furnace

```
ok VNDF E[f·cos/pdf]=0.9811 table=0.9801 · ok CLTC E[f·cos/pdf]=0.4620 ana=0.4623
ok mixture E[f·cos/pdf]=0.5208 furnace=0.5204
```

### M2 aniso rotation + coat frame

```
ok aniso equivariance (worst 4.79e-06)
ok aniso energy θ=45° (0.5187 vs 0.5190) · θ=90° (0.5191 vs 0.5190)   ← rotation preserves energy
ok rotated mixture E[f·cos/pdf]=0.5203 furnace=0.5198
ok rotated specular reciprocity metal=0/1 (worst 2.80e-06 / 2.75e-06)
ok tilted coat albedo ≤ 1 (0.4234 / 0.3765 / 0.4027 / 0.3774)
ok coat continuity 2° (0.3868 vs 0.3844) · ok tilted-coat mixture E[f·cos/pdf]=0.3812 furnace=0.3813
```

### M3 Charlie bake + rescale safety — all 1024 texels in [0,1]

```
1024/1024 texels E_c ∈ [0,1] (min 0.0000, max 1.0000)
max E_c=1.0000 max R=0.7497 max rescale·R=1.0000 clamps hi=433 lo=21
```

### M3 consumption matrix — 128/128 (8 selections × 16 channels)

Every selection consumes exactly its documented channels — the wiring the renderer branches on.

### M3 cloth path — velvet signatures + LTC-sheen closure

```
ok cloth albedo ≤ 1 (1.0064 / 1.0002 / 1.0031 / 1.0004)          ← ≤ 1.01 tolerance (MC noise)
ok sheen lobe retro-ordered (0.1368 > 0.1161 > 0.0998)
    retro=0.3015 side=0.1603 fwd=0.0893 → ok cloth stack retro-dominant
    grazing/normal sheen weight ×98.6 / ×3.9 / ×3.4 → ok velvet signature (fuzzR=0.35/0.65/0.80)
ok cloth mixture E[f·cos/pdf]=0.6759 furnace=0.6755
ok weak-GGX reciprocal (2.71e-06) · ok EON reciprocal (1.17e-07)
ok LTC sheen asymmetry bounded (grid-worst 1.24 — documented fit artifact, grazing-driven)
ok cloth eta unmodulated (1.5) · cloth F0 = 0.04 · rescale matches bake · layer weight = F·rescale·R
ok sheen E[f·cos/pdf]=0.04188 albedo=0.04189 / 0.24519 vs 0.24532  ← sampler reproduces albedo
ok cloth spec
